# SABRE Core

## Overview

The SABRE network is a framework for sharing and managing information in the virtual battlespace. It functions as a way to share centerally stored information with various clients.

The clients operate on a "pull" model, whereby they poll the server for new information periodically.

## Components

The idea behind the system is that individual components can be built on top of this information sharing model and can then be toggled to suite the needs of the mission - Enabling only the systems that a mission maker wants to have available.

## Getting Started

To access information contained on the network, clients must have a "SABRE Tablet" - Currently there is nothing that constrains the ability to recieve information, but there will be future changes to this.
